## Project Structure

- `eeg_classification.py`: Main script containing data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Model Architecture

The project uses EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network designed specifically for EEG signal processing. The model architecture includes:

- Temporal convolution
- Depthwise spatial convolution
- Separable convolution
- Batch normalization
- Dropout regularization

## Results

The models' performances were evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

### EEGNet Performance

The EEGNet model achieved the following results:

- Accuracy: 0.8577
- Precision: 0.8578
- Recall: 0.8577
- F1 Score: 0.8577

These results indicate that the EEGNet model performs well in classifying EEG data, with consistent performance across all metrics.

### TSception Performance

The TSception model showed the following performance over 40 epochs:
The TSception model's accuracy fluctuated between 49.88% and 50.12% throughout the training process, suggesting that the model is not learning effectively from the data. This performance is close to random guessing for a binary classification task.

### Comparison

The EEGNet model significantly outperformed the TSception model on this particular dataset. While EEGNet achieved high accuracy and consistent performance across all metrics, TSception struggled to learn meaningful patterns from the data.

Further investigation may be needed to understand why TSception underperformed, which could involve:
- Adjusting the TSception model architecture
- Modifying hyperparameters
- Investigating the data preprocessing steps
- Ensuring the input data format is correct for the TSception model

These results highlight the importance of model selection and optimization in EEG classification tasks, as different architectures can lead to vastly different performances on the same dataset.
